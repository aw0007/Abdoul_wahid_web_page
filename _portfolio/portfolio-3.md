Coauthored with **Idriss Adoum Adoum** and **Windkpuere Samuel Compaoré**, this study investigates the prevalence of HIV in Namibia by analyzing socio-economic, cultural, and behavioral factors. We utilize data from the 2013 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and employ a Probit model to examine the determinants of HIV serostatus. The analysis uncovers key trends, such as the influence of age at first sexual encounter, number of unions, and total sexual partners on the likelihood of infection. The findings reveal significant disparities in rural areas, particularly linked to education level and occupation, emphasizing the critical role of education in mitigating risks. Despite notable progress in combating HIV, the study underscores the need for targeted efforts with strategies tailored to the diverse socio-economic and cultural realities of Namibia. 

The study also identifies limitations, including the necessity of more recent and longitudinal data, to deepen the understanding of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Namibia and to refine future interventions.
