This study explores the prevalence of HIV in Namibia by analyzing socio-economic, cultural, and behavioral factors. Using data from the 2013 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), our Probit model investigates HIV serostatus, revealing key trends such as the influence of age at first sexual encounter, number of unions, and total sexual partners on the likelihood of infection. Significant disparities in rural areas based on education level and occupation highlight the critical role of education in reducing risks. Despite progress, targeted efforts with strategies tailored to diverse socio-economic and cultural realities remain essential. Limitations, including the need for more recent and longitudinal data, are identified to deepen the understanding of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Namibia.
