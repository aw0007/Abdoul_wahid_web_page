This project explores the dynamics of tax revenue across regions over four decades (1980–2020), leveraging the UNU-WIDER Government Revenue Dataset (GRD). The study focuses on key tax components such as direct taxes, indirect taxes (e.g., VAT), property taxes, and taxes on international trade to provide insights into fiscal policies, revenue mobilization, and regional disparities.

We employ advanced data processing and econometric tools to generate insights into tax revenue patterns across Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. This analysis provides actionable recommendations for policymakers and development practitioners to enhance tax collection and fiscal sustainability.

### **Key Insights and Actionable Takeaways**

#### **Direct Taxes Including Social Contributions**
- **Observation:** Europe consistently demonstrates the highest reliance on direct taxes as a percentage of GDP, while Africa lags behind. This reflects stronger tax administration and enforcement in Europe.
- **Policy Insight:** African policymakers should prioritize investments in digital tax systems and implement targeted audits to enhance compliance among high-income earners.

#### **Indirect Taxes (e.g., VAT)**
- **Observation:** Indirect taxes (e.g., VAT) form the backbone of tax revenue in Africa and the Americas, where enforcement is easier compared to direct taxes. However, this places a disproportionate burden on low-income populations.
- **Policy Insight:** To ensure equity, governments in these regions should broaden the VAT base while offering exemptions for essential goods and targeted cash transfers to support vulnerable households.

#### **Property Taxes**
- **Observation:** Property taxes are underutilized globally, contributing less than 1% of GDP in most regions, except in Europe where robust valuation systems exist.
- **Policy Insight:** Nations in Africa and Asia can improve property tax collection by modernizing land registries and utilizing GIS technology for accurate property valuation.

#### **Taxes on International Trade**
- **Observation:** Africa relies heavily on trade taxes (e.g., import/export duties) due to weak domestic tax systems, though this reliance has decreased since the 1990s with trade liberalization.
- **Policy Insight:** Policymakers should diversify revenue streams by strengthening VAT systems and introducing export-friendly policies to boost trade competitiveness.
