Explore my GitHub repositories for code samples and project analyses:

1. [China Financial Flow](https://github.com/aw0007/China-financial-flow): Analysis of Chinese financial flows and their impact on economic development.

This repository contains replication files and documentation for the project "Chinese Financial Flows: A Growth Lever for Recipient Economies?" The analysis evaluates the impact of Chinese financial flows on the economic development of recipient countries using econometric and statistical tools.

Tools and Methods Used:
- R: Data preprocessing, visualization, and descriptive analysis.
- Stata: Econometric modeling and statistical analysis.
- Python: Advanced network graph creation and geographic mapping.

2. [Tax Data Analysis](https://github.com/aw0007/Tax-Data-Analysis): Statistical analysis and insights into regional tax trends and revenue mobilization.

This repository contains scripts and replication files for the **Tax Data Analysis** project, which explores regional trends in taxation, focusing on direct taxes, VAT, property taxes, and international trade taxes as a percentage of GDP. The project uses Stata for data processing, econometric analysis, and visualization of results.

Tools and Methods Used:
- **Stata**: Data cleaning, panel setup, and graphical visualizations.
- **Excel**: Input data preparation and formatting.
