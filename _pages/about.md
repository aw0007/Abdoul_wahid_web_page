Welcome! I’m **Abdoul Wahid Massaoudou Namata**, an economist with a deep passion for advancing development economics and exploring solutions to global challenges. My research focuses on the intersection of **econometrics**, **development policy**, and **international taxation**, particularly the role of tax treaties in fostering sustainable domestic revenue mobilization for developing countries.

### Academic Journey
I am currently a **Ph.D. candidate in Economics** at **Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM)**, where I am delving into issues surrounding **tax treaties** and their implications for developing economies. My academic background includes a **Master’s in Development Economics** from the University Clermont-Auvergne, CERDI, and a **Bachelor’s in Economics and Management** from Hassan II University. These experiences have shaped my expertise in econometric analysis, development finance, and policy evaluation.

### Professional Highlights
My professional journey spans impactful roles such as a **Research Assistant** at **Orange Innovation Research** in Paris, where I applied advanced econometric and machine learning techniques to evaluate social policies, and at **LASAARE** in Morocco, where I explored sustainable water management and resource efficiency. These opportunities have honed my skills in data analysis, impact evaluation, and policy design.

### Research Interests
My research explores critical global issues, including:
- **International Taxation**: Understanding how tax treaties impact fiscal policy and development.
- **Economic Development**: Investigating the role of international financial flows on economic growth.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Assessing socio-economic determinants of resource consumption in urban contexts.

### Beyond Academia
Outside of my research and professional pursuits, I actively engage in community initiatives. As the **President of the Scientific, Sports, and Cultural Week** during my undergraduate years, I spearheaded projects promoting collaboration and leadership. My passion for teamwork extends to my hobbies, including basketball and football, which have taught me the importance of strategy, adaptability, and resilience.

### A Global Perspective
Having studied and worked in multiple countries, I’ve gained a global perspective on economic challenges and cultural diversity. This international experience fuels my drive to contribute to inclusive development policies, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
